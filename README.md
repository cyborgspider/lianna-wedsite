#Lianna & Nat Wedsite

##Overview
I use Grunt JS to build this site (Jade for HTML, Stylus for CSS, and Coffeescript for JavaScript). 

##Installation
Clone repo onto your machine. Enter the directory from your CLI and type "npm install -d"

Make your changes, then from the CLI, enter either of the following commands:
  * grunt build - assembles all the files into one handy "build" folder, this is used for deployment.
  * grunt watch - watches changes to files and builds automatically upon saving the file. Really useful when LiveReload is enabled.

If you are unfamiliar with Grunt or Node.js, or any of the other preprocessor languages, ask Mr. Google. He's always available, but you can contact me as well, I'm sparingly available.

If you don't want to mess with the source files at all, just take the HTML/CSS/JS inside the "build" folder and make the changes there. Just be aware, by doing this, the source and build files will diverge and render this repo useless.
